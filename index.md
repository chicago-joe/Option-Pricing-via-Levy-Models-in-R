  This research explores the implementation of two algorithms for options pricing in LÃ©vy models, 
  specifically comparing the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) process with the Inverse Transform Method. 
  Our implementation builds upon the foundational work by Feng et al. on simulating LÃ©vy processes 
  from their characteristic functions.

## Key Research Components

### Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) Process
Implementation of advanced stochastic processes for more accurate market modeling. The NIG process captures important stylized facts of financial markets including:
- Heavy tails in return distributions
- Volatility clustering
- Asymmetric returns

### Inverse Transform Method
Comparative analysis of computational efficiency and pricing accuracy through:
- Direct simulation from characteristic functions
- Optimized numerical integration techniques
- Performance benchmarking against traditional methods

### Theoretical Foundation
Building upon the seminal work by Feng et al. on simulating LÃ©vy processes from characteristic functions, we extend their methodology to:
- Discrete-time option pricing models
- Efficient calibration procedures
- Risk-neutral measure transformations

### Practical Applications
Real-world options pricing scenarios and performance benchmarking including:
- European option pricing
- American option approximations
- Exotic derivatives valuation
- Greeks calculation and hedging strategies

## Research Objectives

1. **Develop robust implementations** of both pricing algorithms in R
2. **Conduct comprehensive performance analysis** comparing computational efficiency
3. **Validate pricing accuracy** against market data and theoretical benchmarks
4. **Provide practical guidance** for practitioners in quantitative finance

## Methodology

Our research methodology combines theoretical analysis with empirical validation:
