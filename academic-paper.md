## Technical Highlights

### Characteristic Function Approach

The authors leverage the analytical tractability of characteristic functions:

```{math}
\phi_X(u) = \mathbb{E}[e^{iuX}] = \exp\left\{t\psi(u)\right\}
```

where $\psi(u)$ is the characteristic exponent of the LÃ©vy process.

### Computational Efficiency

Performance comparisons show significant improvements:

| Model | RMSE | Computational Time | Memory Usage |
|-------|------|-------------------|--------------|
| Traditional MC | 0.0234 | 45.3s | 2.1 GB |
| FFT Method | 0.0198 | 3.2s | 0.4 GB |
| Series Expansion | 0.0205 | 5.7s | 0.6 GB |

### Numerical Stability

The paper addresses critical numerical challenges:

- Handling of infinite activity processes
- Control of discretization errors
- Mitigation of round-off errors
- Adaptive algorithm selection

## Implementation Examples

The paper provides detailed implementation guidance:

```{code-block} r
:caption: Example NIG Process Simulation
:linenos:

# Simulate NIG process using characteristic function
simulate_NIG <- function(n, dt, alpha, beta, delta, mu) {
  # Generate subordinator
  G <- rgamma(n, shape = dt * delta, rate = 1)
  
  # Generate Brownian motion
  W <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(G))
  
  # Construct NIG process
  X <- mu * dt + beta * G + W
  
  return(X)
}
```
